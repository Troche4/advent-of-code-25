Set up and usage:
1. Run `npm install` to install any dependencies.
2. Run `npm start x` where X is the day you want to see a solution for.

NOTE: all puzzle inputs will not be committed, so you will need to create a file in the same directory as each day's solution file, and most likely title it input.txt
